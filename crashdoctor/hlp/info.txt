CrashDoctor:
============
CrashDoctor is a program developed to recover crashing programs. It works
as a windows JIT debugger and activates when a program crashes. Once user
selects to recover the crashing program, it attaches to the program and
tries to recover them from the crash by either skipping the faulting
instruction or skipping the faulting function. This can be useful in
complex programs where a non-critical part of the software crashes. In
such cases, it may be better to skip the faulting instruction or function
than let the whole application crash, which may result in information loss.

CrashDoctor has another useful feature. Once a program crashes, CrashDoctor
monitors the execution of the program. If the program tries to open an existing
file for writing, CrashDoctor intercepts this and copies the original file
to a backup location. This prevents any further damage done by the misbehaving
program. The current version of CrashDoctor however doesn't prevent this if
program already has these files open.

CrashDoctor also works like a debugger chooser. After installing CrashDoctor
if a program crashes, the CrashDoctor recovery screen shows up. This screen
lists debuggers available on the system and you can select a debugger to debug
the crashing program instead of recovering it from crash. Note that once you
start debugging the program, you won't be able to recover it.


Words about Crash:
==================
A crash can happen in a process due to various reasons like accessing invalid
memory locations, resource constraints, resource unavailability etc. One thing
to note here is that a crash almost always occur due to bad programming such as
not handling error conditions properly.

CrashDoctor tries to recover all the crashes. Sometime the crash is so fatal
that repeated attempts to recover it fails and in such case, CrashDoctor
terminates the process and displays the exit code of the process.


Updates:
========
Please check http://www.intellectualheaven.com to make sure that you have
the latest version of CrashDoctor


Features:
=========
- Runs as JIT debugger so no overhead when no program is crashing
- Extremely light-weight and doesn't slow down the process even when recovering
  it from the crash
- Once a process crashes, CrashDoctor intercepts if the process tries to open
  a file for write and makes a backup copy of the file to prevent data loss
- Works as a debugger chooser also if you have multiple debuggers in your
  system. Upon a program crash, you can chose which debugger to use to debug
  the program (in case you don't want to recover the process from crashing).
- Comes with an easy to use graphical user interface
- 100% free of cost


Known Limitation:
=================
- Does not create backup copy of files that are already open by the crashing
  program, thus CrashDoctor doesn't prevent data corruption of files that are
  already open by the crashing program.


Changelog:
========
v1.0 (Released) (2005/04/18)
- Created a version for AMD64
- Improved crash recovery for x86 as well as added enhanced crash recovery
  for AMD64
- Improved the color-scheme for better readability

v0.9 (Beta1) (2005/03/20)
This is the first public release of CrashDoctor and it is also declared Beta1.
This means that even though the program is throughly tested, there may be some
unearthed bugs. If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please drop
a mail to x_pankaj_x@intellectualheaven.com


Supported platforms:
====================
Windows XP - Windows 8.1 (both 32-bit and 64-bit)


License:
========
BSD License


Warning:
========
Once you tries to recovery a process, you won't be able to debug it or generate
a crash dump for that process.


Usage:
======
After installation of CrashDoctor, it will activate itself whenever a program
crashes.
